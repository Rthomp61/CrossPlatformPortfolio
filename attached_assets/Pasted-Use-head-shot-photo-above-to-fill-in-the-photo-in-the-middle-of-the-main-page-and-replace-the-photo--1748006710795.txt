ABOUT ME SECTION:  About Me 
I’m a former corporate trainer turned AI-native builder — blending a decade of leadership in sales, retail, and operations with cutting-edge skills in AI product development, UX/UI design, and voice-first automation.

Currently deep into Pursuit’s elite AI training program, I’ve built and shipped multiple real-world apps, including MARS (Medication Automation Reminder System) and EMS (Expense Management System), using tools like React Native, Firebase, vector databases, and the Expo Speech API. I specialize in designing intuitive, human-centered experiences backed by modern tech stacks.

Every project I touch is built with purpose — from healthcare to personal finance — and I’m passionate about using AI to create scalable, meaningful, and inclusive solutions.

What I Bring to the Table:
* AI-native mindset with rapid MVP execution
* Voice-enabled UX & automation workflows
* Product thinking + user empathy from day one
* Real-world experience leading, coaching, and delivering
* 
I’m actively looking to join a forward-thinking team or AI-driven company where I can contribute, grow, and scale impactful products.

Let’s build the future — together.
